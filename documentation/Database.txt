	The database is small and simple at this point.
	
	We have a user table and a system table. There is a foriegn key in the system table that will contain a userID.
	
	The user table contains a userID, username and password. This information is currently stored in the db as plain text.
	
	Future revsions can add additional tables and make the plain text in hash values, etc.
